DumboDisney rProudly Presents Jamie's Fox's Jamaica's Fox's Megan's Fox's Daughters (who made her acting debut in the family film Holiday in the Sun?) Jumbo as in Black Dumbo.

The Daughters of Men.

Republicans get to make this movie in Hell, move over Democrats, shove off, shove off.

Megan Fox is Megan Fox in The Daughters of Man.

Her sons are all growed up now.

They still wear dresses and high heels and they are about to break their high heels on the crack in the pavement street and over your fucking heads you bastards. They be pissed now, but they are just chilling out smoking some crack COCAINE up their white noses.

She is like the wicked witch, morons.

She is wiser now.

She sends out dragons to bring back her filthy sons from their daily orgy.

The women and girls and men and boys scatter like death of democracy in darkness.

Republicans made this movie.

A rival family, unnamed is shown in a dimly lit room. A table sits in the center. Ordered documents and tools scattered about.

This movie makes no sense.

A flickering image of themselves flashes on the screen.

Deadpool busts out of the screen and says you dumb bitches just got rrick rolled and Disney sues you...???

No that's how they just make movies now.

They turn off the screen and the room goes black.
